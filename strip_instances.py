"""Remove product instances from objects.xml file.

A bug in Zenoss' ZenPack export causes it to export individual instances
of product classes to the objects.xml file. These instances are related to
devices added to the running Zenoss system, and are not applicable to anyone
else who would install the ZenPack.

It is expected that this script would be located, and executed from the
top-level directory of the ZenPack.
